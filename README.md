# CryosisEngine

The Cryosis Engine is a game-development engine built off on Monogame and Microsoft's XNA framework. The engine focuses on bringing powerful entity-component API to XNA, and comes with out-the-box tools such as texture atlases, sprite sheets, dynamic audio systems, and more.

## Suppported Platforms

The Cryosis Engine is built upon C# 7.0 and utilizes XML data files. It is currently tested for Windows 10/11, with cross-platform development in the works.

## Content Templates

The Cryosis Engine operates with a static file structure for content and assets. To understand the file structure, see [Templates/Content](Project1/Templates/Content), or built the git from source.
